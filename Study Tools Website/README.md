This website demostrates my HTML & CSS skills. For this website I had to work within a team. My role was to design and create the front-end for the website. To see the entire website repository follow this link (https://github.com/fredRobson345/Collab25). With this website I aimed to create a easy to read and navigate system which would allow persons of all ages to navigate, as it is aimed at students in education as it creates study tools.
